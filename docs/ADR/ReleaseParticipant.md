# Release participant
(will be included in v2)

For all release mechanism, there will always be three stages for participant:
1. Participation declaration
2. Filter participants by release mechanism
3. Participants commit action

The first stage should be included in launchpad module because this will be true to all release mechanism. And, it will be easier to share this participation list to all release mechanism.

The second and third stage will be included in release mechanism module because each module will have different logic for this.
